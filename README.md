# Overwatch 1.74 Lobby Server

An offline lobby server for Overwatch 1.74 (build 104319) on Windows.

## How to start

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) 3.10 or newer.
2. Double-click `START.bat`.
3. Choose a mode. Press Enter for the normal one (retail).
4. The first time, pick your `Overwatch.exe`.

The server and the game start. Keep the black window open while you play.

To switch modes, close the game and the black window, then start `START.bat` again and choose another mode.

- **Play in retail mode**: the default Overwatch menu, with a hero in the lobby.
- **Play in tournament mode**: the mode used on LANs by pros, with a simpler menu.
- **Server only**: only the server, for players on other PCs (see below).
- **Join a server in retail mode**: play on someone else's server with the default Overwatch menu. Type its address, like `1.2.3.4:12357`, and your name. The next time, Enter reuses them.
- **Join a server in tournament mode**: the same with the mode used on LANs by pros.

## Host a server for others

Choose **Server only**. It shows the addresses players on your network can use. For players over the internet, open TCP port 3724 (the lobby) and UDP port 3730 (matches) in your firewall and router, start the server with your public address, and give players that address, for example `1.2.3.4:3724`:

```
START.bat --mode server --game-host 1.2.3.4
```

They choose one of the **Join a server** modes in `START.bat`. Another lobby port: `--port 12357`.

The server reads each map's collision from your own copy of the game, so start `START.bat` in retail mode once first to pick your `Overwatch.exe`. It builds a map's collision the first time a match is played there, or all maps at once with `py tools/build_collision.py`.

A match starts when its teams are full. To start it with fewer players, set "Players to start" in the dashboard or add `--test-players 2`.

To play on it yourself too, start `START.bat` once more and choose **Join a server in retail mode** with `127.0.0.1:3724`. The dashboard stays reachable only on your own computer.

Anyone can log in with any name, so a player can take another player's name.

To manage your profile, events and loot boxes, open http://127.0.0.1:3725 in your browser.

The game is not included. You need your own copy of build 1.74.0.0.104319.

## Without START.bat

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```
py -m ow174
```

It asks for the mode too. To skip the question, give it: `py -m ow174 --mode tournament`. `py -m ow174 --help` lists all options.

## If something goes wrong

- Start the game only with `START.bat` or `py -m ow174`, not from a shortcut.
- If your antivirus blocks it, add this folder and the game folder to its exceptions.
- If the game asks for an email and password, type anything. The server does not check them.
- Logs are in the `logs` folder. Send `logs/ow174.log` when you ask for help.

## For developers

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt ruff
py -m ruff check .
py -B -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The code is in `ow174/`. The relay DLL source is in `relay/`.
